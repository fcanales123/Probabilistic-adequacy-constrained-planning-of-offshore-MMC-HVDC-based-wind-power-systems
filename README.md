# Probabilistic-adequacy-constrained-planning-of-offshore-MMC-HVDC-based-wind-power-systems

This repository contains MATLAB functions for the probabilistic adequacy-constrained planning of offshore MMC-HVDC-based wind power systems. The research objective is to develop models and evaluation tools that quantify reliability by integrating the stochastic nature of wind generation, component failures, and maintenance strategies. The work follows a probabilistic research approach, employing methods such as state enumeration, continuous time Markov chains, convolution of probability distributions, and reliability evaluation. Data are obtained through analytical probabilistic modelling of wind farms, Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs), DC stations, and Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) networks, producing capacity output probability distributions, transition matrices, and key system cost and reliability indices.
